italaheb - (Is there a line at H-E-B)
This project is a small web application whose purpose is to update google map markers with the length of lines outside grocery stores during peak shopping hours. The line lengths on the markers are crowd driven and encourages people who are at their respectives sites to contribute accurate counts.

Technologies used: freehosting.com, DirectAdmin, MAMP stack, PDO, Javascript, XML, AJAX, Google Maps API, HTML, CSS, and git.

Reflection: This project was a great way to expand my knowledge and gain actual implementation experience. The site was developed locally and pushed onto a real website as changes were made through git. Through the painstaking process of debugging, I was made aware of new obstacles such as how code is implented in different browsers, caching, and the infamous centering of a div. I practiced proper code hygiene by dividing code segments into their respective files, using prepared statements for all database queries to offer protection against SQL injections, utilized a .gitignore file to remove non-production worthy files, removed my API key from code as well as limit the key's use to specific sites and a quota.
